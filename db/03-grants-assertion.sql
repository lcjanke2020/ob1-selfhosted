-- invariant assertion for openbrain_app grants on public.thoughts.
--
-- Why this is its own file:
--
-- The natural place for this DO-block would have been at the end of
-- 01-schema.sql, right after the REVOKE+GRANT that establishes the
-- intended privilege state. But that placement makes the assertion
-- useless for the case this assertion actually cares about — "an
-- assertion query for deployed DBs so live deployments + restores stay
-- aligned." Re-running 01-schema.sql against a drifted DB starts with
-- `REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM openbrain_app`, which
-- wipes any drift (e.g. a stray GRANT DELETE) BEFORE the assertion
-- could observe it. The assertion in that placement only catches
-- in-file drift of the GRANT list itself.
--
-- Putting the assertion in its own file solves both cases:
--   1. Fresh init: docker-entrypoint-initdb.d runs files in lexical
--      order. 01- establishes grants, 02- adds observability grants,
--      03- asserts. If a future change to 02-observability.sql (or
--      any later file) accidentally widens openbrain_app's grants on
--      `public.thoughts`, init fails loudly.
--   2. Drift check against a deployed DB: an operator can run this
--      file standalone (`psql -f db/03-grants-assertion.sql`) against
--      a live DB and the assertion exercises the LIVE catalog state
--      without mutating anything — no REVOKE+GRANT to wipe the drift
--      first. This is the intended contract.
--
-- Invariants checked:
--   (a) `openbrain_app` must NOT have DELETE on `public.thoughts`.
--   (b) `openbrain_app` MUST have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on
--       `public.thoughts`.
--
-- We don't try to enforce a schema-wide invariant — 02-observability.sql
-- legitimately grants additional tables to openbrain_app and we don't
-- want to couple this file to that one's grant list.
